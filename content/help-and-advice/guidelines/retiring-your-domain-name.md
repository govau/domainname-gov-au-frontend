  # Retiring your domain name 

  **Prior to retiring or decommissioning domain names, it is recommended you do the following:**
  
  - Decide whether the domain name will be maintained and redirected, or whether it should be completely decommissioned.
  - Consider any other services that may be reliant on the domain name, including email, file transfer protocol (FTP) and subdomain names.
  - If the domain name is to be decommissioned, the Admin contact should [request a deletion](../../manage/delete) from the domain name system.
  - If the domain is to be redirected, ensure that redirection instructions are built into the DNS record.
